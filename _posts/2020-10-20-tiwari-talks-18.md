‌In my perspective it is easier to make people sad than to make happy coz you can abuse someone
‌Cheat on them broke them easily and make them cry , make them dipressed but in order to make them smile u need to need to collect the broken pieces and make them stack one by one it takes a lot of effort to give your happines to the one whom u love to make them happy, like while writing this and the other tiwari talks I know I am not well, I know that my hands are shivering but I will write every single day and put my every single ounce to bring smiles on the faces of my special ones💖 I know that my writings aren't that well but I will try every single day Now ,I take a leave tell me if I said it right or not ( everyone those who will see coz it means a lot if u appreciate or correct if I am going wrong 💖♥️
