Find a person who changes fears into cheers
Find a person who tries to never see your cries 
Find a person who changes your sadness into smile by giving his happiness
Find a person who  you lets you lead him even when he's blind
In the darkness, in the middle of the night
In the silence, when there's no one by his side 
Find a person who is scared to be lonely without u coz he's never gonna leave u ♥️♥️♥️💖...
