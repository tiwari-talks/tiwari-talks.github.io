Basically love is  a nostalgia where your (my) happiness is when u are happy when u laugh at my lame jokes for no reason when u become childish , when u are not self obsessed when u smile with a dimple showing ur battisi ðŸ˜‚ when u don't give a damn fuck to what are bitching about u 

When u are dada of bhuvan when u call ur friend as ur beti when u talk to me when u eat like a bhukkad when u call me with my nickname ( hsina ) ab manane mat lag jaana ki hsina maan jaaegi ðŸ¤­ aur when u are befikar ... Just keep going don't stop that's all ðŸ’–ðŸ’–
